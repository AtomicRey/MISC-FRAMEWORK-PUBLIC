# More Independent Slots for Characters (MISC)
## What the fuck is it?
Just some framework to add characters without replacing other guys in the game. The framework makes use of string saving to allow for a modifiable MISC order based on mod priority and whatnot.
With current limitations, MISC has a potential of 250 character slots because of character slots being built off of the same ones as the default 3AIR system.
## Why use it?
For fun
## Can I use it?
Sure just give credit where it's due because Ramona, Reyna, and Monty are the crutch of the framework and without any one of them the framework would either not exist or be complete dogshit
