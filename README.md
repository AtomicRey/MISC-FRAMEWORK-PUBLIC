# More Independent Slots for Characters (MISC)
## What the fuck is it?
Just some framework to add characters without replacing other guys in the game. The framework makes use of string saving to allow for a modifiable MISC order based on mod priority and whatnot.
additionally, this framework is built into the character mod, rather than requiring a seperate framework mod like ESU used to.
With current limitations, MISC has a potential of 250 character slots because of character slots being built off of the same ones as the default 3AIR system.
## Why use it?
For fun
## Can I use it?
Sure just give credit where it's due because Ramona, Reyna, and Monty are the crutch of the framework and without any one of them the framework would either not exist or be complete dogshit
## Okay but HOOWWW do I use it huh? How the fuck do I use it!?
okay okay calm down. the instructions for each function are within the scripts itself. 
NOTE that you are required to have beginner to intermediate knowledge of how to make mods for sonic 3 air, and at least some basic scripting knowledge.
OPTIONAL files are, as the name suggest, optional. this currently contains the SpecialPlayers custom player 2s addon. but it's very complicated and not reccomended for beginners.
the scripts in "Editable scripts" are the ones you want to modify to get your character set up. The ones in "Non-Editable scripts" are ones you do not want to touch.
Some scripts don't necessarily need to be edited (outside of renaming variables to your character) such as AdvancedFunctions, or Renderchar.
